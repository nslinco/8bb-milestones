Once you download the project, all you have to do is click the Play button!

This repo was only used for milestones, as Github does not easily support unity projects.

Description of our dropbox structure:
Project layout is automatically determined by Unity.
Inside the "8BB_SmashHero" folder, there are many C Sharp scripts, and subfolders.
"Assets" stores data from implemented packages from the Unity Asset Store. This was mainly used to convert chart files into notes on the page.
"Library" stores much of the data about our scenes and how they should be initialized.
"Packages" was used to implement our database
"Project Settings" stores the project settings
Other folders are empty

To Run Project:
Download the folder from dropbox.
